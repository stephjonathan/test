1. How do you prevent the user from submitting the form prematurely when the user hit enter?

- By not using autofocus so no fields are being focused on since the beginning of page load
- By using validations to make sure fields are not empty before submitting


2. How do you add validation and error messages to the form?

Validation
- HTML input required="required" attribute (only checks for empty inputs)
- Client-side validation (JavaScript including AJAX/JQuery) though it won't work if JavaScript is disabled on the client
- Server-side validation (PHP/JSP/etc. depends on the server-side script used)

Error messages
- Alert (not user-friendly)
- Containers for error messages
