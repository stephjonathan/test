1. How do you prevent the user from submitting the form prematurely when the user hit enter?

- By not using autofocus so no fields are being focused on since the beginning of page load
- By using validations to make sure fields are not empty before submitting


2. How do you add validation and error messages to the form?

Validation
- HTML input required="required" attribute (only checks for empty inputs)
- JavaScript (client-side validation, not recommended as JS can be disabled)
- Server-side script (PHP/JSP/etc.)

Error messages
- Alert
- Container for error messages
